## Review

Going through this course felt like watching a TV Show on Netflix. Every lesson was like an interesting episode that left you with a cliffhanger. But - you can't binge watch it. Luckily you don't have to wait for a whole week to get the next dose of the course - John sends them out twice a week. And I felt sorry when it was over!

John Sonmez, the guy behind [SimpleProgrammer](http://simpleprogrammer.com), did an excellent job on creating this course. I started this blog as a result of John's blog course, so I want to share my experience with it.

### TL;DR

It's awesome! Check it out here:

### Why it's so good

The course consists of highly structured, atomic lessons, with each one requiring you to take action at the end.

This approach works. You don't feel like you're doing hard work because the lessons are small, focused and fun. But, in reality, you accomplish quite a task - creating a blog and having a clear vision of what you'll write about.

Sending small lessons few times a week creates a sense of anticipation - it makes you excited for the next one. This was a highly effective approach for me, and I believe most people would be amazed at how it changes their mindset. Instead of getting a lengthy book containing all this information at once, John spaces out the lessons just enough to make you actually want to learn. You even do the homework with enthusiasm! You don't feel like you're doing some boring work (like reading a dull book), but you feel like you're playing. And learning through play is probably the most effective way of learning.

### Tell me more!

Ok, here's how the course works.

- John sends you lessons via email twice a week.
- Each lesson talks about a specific aspect of creating a blog.
- At the end of each lesson, there is a task.
- Through completion of these small tasks, you eventually create a blog!
- And my personal favorite: John asks you to send him your homework by replying to his email. He actually reads your response, looks at what you've done, and replies back with his comments and support.

That personal touch is so valuable. When working on a project, expert's feedback can be the difference between the project failing and succeeding. John's feedback makes it just so easy and fun to succeed.

## SimpleProgrammer

One day I stumbled upon this site, [SimpleProgrammer](http://simpleprogrammer.com). I started reading some posts, and I found them inspiring and useful. The guy behind it is John Sonmez, and he doesn't talk about new frameworks or coding techniques. Instead, his passion lays is the other half of any developers life: everything that's not strictly related to your technical expertise, but will help you advance your career way more than learning a new framework.

You will find posts on topics like how to negotiate your salary or if you need to have a degree in computer science to have a successful career in software development. But that is only the top of the iceberg. John creates tons of free quality content each week. Blog posts, podcasts, YouTube videos where he answers people's questions - he's all over the place. I'm telling you this because his advice genuinely impacted my career for the better. I feel like I stumbled onto this fountain of knowledge called SimpleProgrammer, and I just want to share it with everyone.

### Getting ready to act

So, in all that content, I found that John was offering this Free course on starting your own blog. I signed up immediately. Why? Granted, I like to write. But that's not it. Through his texts and videos, John gets you into this awesome mindset where you can't stand to just sit around anymore, you want to create something, to teach others, to spread good vibes. He is FULL or positive energy and magically transfers some of it to you while reading or listening to him.

### Importance of branding yourself

But here's another reason why you'd want to start your own blog. John talks a lot about the importance of branding yourself in order to achieve great things in your career as a software developer. Having a blog will help you gain reputation and presence on the Internet, both of which are priceless in the IT world.

### It won't be a piece of cake

But, to get there, you need to be prepared for some serious work. When you first start a blog, you may feel like you are not a good enough to be writing. You'll think that writing one - or more - blog posts a week is impossible. You'll be afraid to open yourself to criticism by publishing your thoughts for everyone to see.

### Overcoming your fears

If these things scare you, don't worry. They should. It's no small deed creating and maintaining a blog. But in his course, John will help you overcome ALL of these scary thoughts, and he will help you take action. You will actually have you blog online and ready for great posts once you finish the course. You will be equipped with techniques to tackle any topic and not give up.

Try the course for yourself and come back here to tell me what you think. And share it with your friends!
