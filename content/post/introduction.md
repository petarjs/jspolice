JS Police - What is it? Find out about our goal in this post.

## What?

**JS Police** is a blog where you can read about new and cool open source js libraries.  
But that's not all! We investigate the library's code, and look into architecture and style.  
We will know if there are no tests.  

We have nice code snippets.

````js
var jsPolice = 'js'.concat('Police');

function makeAnArrest(repo) {
  return new JSPolice(repo, { arest: true });
}
````

## Why?

So why are we doing all this detective work?

- Learning good code patterns through review
- Discovering architecture and code styles
- Currate a list of awesome small libs
- Document the API, the build process and the contribution process of a library
- Lower the barrier to enter and start contributing to an Open Source project

What we're hoping to acheive is an improvement in the way open source projects are written by the community, by shredding some light onto the sometimes shady innards of a typical open source js lib.  
Most people who create these small libs, they do it, and they move on with their life, thinking they got away easy.  

## Not today. The JSPolice is here.

* Now, this is all in good fun and with educational value being the main purpose.  

Of course we won't shame anyone who didn't write tests for his code.  
We should all understand that behind all of these projects stand real people, who devote large amounts of time and energy into creating something others may find useful. They do it in their spare time, because they are passionate about software development and being open source. If you find sparkles of such passion in yourself, try contributing to an open source project. You'll love it!
