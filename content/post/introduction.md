**JS Police - You have the right to remain open source**  
**JS Police - You have the right to refactor**

  return new JSPolice(repo, { arest: true });

# What?

**JS Police** is a very cool blog where you can read about cool open source js libraries.  
But that's not all! We investigate the library's code, we look into architecture and style.  
We will know if there are no tests.  

# Why?

What we're hoping to acheive is improvement in the way open source projects are written by the community, by shredding some light onto the sometimes shady innards of a typical open source js lib.  
Most people who create these small libs, they do it, and they move on with their life, thinking they got away easy.  

## Not today. The JSPolice is here.
